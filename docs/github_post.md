# Automate Your Content Publishing with the MCP Publish Flow

Are you tired of manually publishing your content to multiple platforms like Substack and Medium? Do you wish there was a way to streamline this process, ensuring consistency, security, and monitoring?

Introducing the **MCP Publish Flow**, a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server designed to automate your content publishing workflow. This project provides a robust and flexible solution for managing and publishing your articles directly from your development environment.

## What is the MCP Publish Flow?

The MCP Publish Flow is a backend service that integrates with MCP-compatible clients (like Claude Desktop or Cursor) to offer powerful publishing capabilities. It acts as a central hub for your content, allowing you to define, manage, and publish articles to various platforms using simple commands.

## Key Features

This project is built with several core features to make your publishing life easier:

*   **Content Management:** Process Markdown files with frontmatter, handle images, validate content, and manage drafts and revisions.
*   **Security:** Ensure your publishing process is secure with JWT authentication, rate limiting, and request validation.
*   **Monitoring:** Keep an eye on your server's performance and publishing activity with Prometheus metrics integration, health checks, and error tracking.

## How it Works

The MCP Publish Flow exposes a set of tools that can be invoked by an MCP client. These tools handle the heavy lifting of interacting with publishing platforms like Substack and Medium.

For example, you can use tools like `publish_to_substack` or `publish_to_medium` by providing the path to your Markdown file and relevant metadata (title, tags, etc.). The server processes the file, handles any necessary image uploads, and publishes the content to the specified platform.

## Getting Started

Setting up the MCP Publish Flow is straightforward. You can run it locally using Python or containerize it with Docker and Docker Compose.

1.  **Clone the repository.**
2.  **Install dependencies** using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
3.  **Configure environment variables** by copying `.env.example` to `.env` and filling in your API keys and other settings.
4.  **Run the server** using `python mcp_publish_server.py` or `docker-compose up`.
5.  **Configure your MCP client** (like Claude Desktop or Cursor) to connect to the server running at `http://localhost:8000`.

Detailed setup and configuration instructions can be found in the project's [README.md](link_to_your_github_repo/README.md).

## Usage Examples

Once the server is running and your client is configured, you can start automating your publishing. Here are a few examples of commands you might use:

*   "Publish article.md to Substack with title 'My New Post' and subtitle 'A great read' for paid subscribers"
*   "Publish article.md to Medium with title 'My Tech Post' and tags ['tech', 'coding'] as public"
*   "Check service health status"
